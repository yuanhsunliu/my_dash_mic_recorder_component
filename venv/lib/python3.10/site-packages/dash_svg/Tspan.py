class Tspan(Component):
    """A Tspan component.
Tspan is a wrapper for the <tspan> SVG element.
For detailed attribute info see:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/tspan

Keyword arguments:

- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):
    The children of this component.

- id (string; optional):
    The ID of this component, used to identify dash components in
    callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components
    in an app.

- alignmentBaseline (string | number; optional):
    The alignment-baseline attribute specifies how an object is
    aligned  with respect to its parent. This property specifies which
    baseline of this element is to be aligned with the corresponding
    baseline of the parent. For example, this allows alphabetic
    baselines in Roman text to stay aligned across font size  changes.
    It defaults to the baseline with the same name  as the computed
    value of the alignment-baseline property.Note:  As a presentation
    attribute alignment-baseline can be  used as a CSS property.You
    can use this attribute with  the following SVG elements:The value
    is the dominant-baseline  of the script to which the character
    belongs - i.e., use  the dominant-baseline of the parent.Uses the
    dominant  baseline choice of the parent. Matches the box's
    corresponding  baseline to that of its parent.The alignment-point
    of  the object being aligned is aligned with the \"before-edge\"
    baseline of the parent text content element.Matches the  bottom of
    the box to the top of the parent's content area.The
    alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned  with the
    \"text-before-edge\" baseline of the parent text  content
    element.Note: This keyword may be mapped to text-top.Aligns  the
    vertical midpoint of the box with the baseline of  the parent box
    plus half the x-height of the parent.Matches  the box's central
    baseline to the central baseline of  its parent.The
    alignment-point of the object being aligned  is aligned with the
    \"after-edge\" baseline of the parent  text content
    element.Matches the top of the box to the  top of the parent's
    content area.The alignment-point of  the object being aligned is
    aligned with the \"text-after-edge\"  baseline of the parent text
    content element.Note: This  keyword may be mapped to
    text-bottom.Matches the box's  ideographic character face
    under-side baseline to that  of its parent.Matches the box's
    alphabetic baseline to  that of its parent.The alignment-point of
    the object being  aligned is aligned with the \"hanging\" baseline
    of the  parent text content element.Matches the box's mathematical
    baseline to that of its parent.Aligns the top of the aligned
    subtree with the top of the line box.Aligns the center  of the
    aligned subtree with the center of the line box.Aligns  the bottom
    of the aligned subtree with the bottom of the  line box.SVG 2
    introduces some changes to the definition  of this property. In
    particular: the values auto, before-edge,  and after-edge have
    been removed. For backwards compatibility,  text-before-edge may
    be mapped to text-top and text-after-edge  to text-bottom. Neither
    text-before-edge nor text-after-edge  should be used with the
    vertical-align property.For object  alignment in other elements
    (such as <text>), see dominant-baseline.BCD  tables only load in

- aria-* (string; optional):
    A wildcard aria attribute.

- baselineShift (string | number; optional):
    The baseline-shift attribute allows repositioning of the
    dominant-baseline  relative to the dominant-baseline of the parent
    text content  element. The shifted object might be a sub- or
    superscript.Note:  As a presentation attribute baseline-shift can
    be used  as a CSS property.Note: This property is going to be
    deprecated  and authors are advised to use vertical-align
    instead.You  can use this attribute with the following SVG
    elements:The  dominant-baseline is shifted to the default position
    for  subscripts.The dominant-baseline is shifted to the default
    position for superscripts.A length value raises (positive  value)
    or lowers (negative value) the dominant-baseline  of the parent
    text content element by the specified length.A  percentage value
    raises (positive value) or lowers (negative  value) the
    dominant-baseline of the parent text content  element by the
    specified percentage of the line-height.BCD  tables only load in

- className (string; optional):
    Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.

- colorInterpolation (string | number; optional):
    The color-interpolation attribute specifies the color space for
    gradient interpolations, color animations, and alpha
    compositing.Note:  For filter effects, the
    color-interpolation-filters property  controls which color space
    is used.The color-interpolation  property chooses between color
    operations occurring in  the sRGB color space or in a (light
    energy linear) linearized  RGB color space. Having chosen the
    appropriate color space,  component-wise linear interpolation is
    used.When a child  element is blended into a background, the value
    of the  color-interpolation property on the child determines the
    type of blending, not the value of the color-interpolation  on the
    parent. For gradients which make use of the href  or the
    deprecated xlink:href attribute to reference another  gradient,
    the gradient uses the property's value from  the gradient element
    which is directly referenced by the  fill or stroke property. When
    animating colors, color  interpolation is performed according to
    the value of the  color-interpolation property on the element
    being animated.Note:  As a presentation attribute,
    color-interpolation can be  used as a CSS property.You can use
    this attribute with  the following SVG elements:Indicates that the
    user agent  can choose either the sRGB or linearRGB spaces for
    color  interpolation. This option indicates that the author
    doesn't  require that color interpolation occur in a particular
    color space.Indicates that color interpolation should  occur in
    the sRGB color space.Indicates that color interpolation  should
    occur in the linearized RGB color space as described  in the sRGB
    specification.BCD tables only load in the  browser with JavaScript

- data-* (string; optional):
    A wildcard data attribute.

- direction (string | number; optional):
    The direction attribute specifies the inline-base direction of  a
    <text> or <tspan> element. It defines the start and  end points of
    a line of text as used by the text-anchor  and inline-size
    properties. It also may affect the direction  in which characters
    are positioned if the unicode-bidi  property's value is either
    embed or bidi-override.It applies  only to glyphs oriented
    perpendicular to the inline-base  direction, which includes the
    usual case of horizontally-oriented  Latin or Arabic text and the
    case of narrow-cell Latin  or Arabic characters rotated 90 degrees
    clockwise relative  to a top-to-bottom inline-base direction.In
    many cases,  the bidirectional Unicode algorithm produces the
    desired  result automatically, so this attribute doesn't need to
    be specified in those cases. For other cases, such as  when using
    right-to-left languages, it may be sufficient  to add the
    direction attribute to the outermost <svg>  element, and allow
    that direction to inherit to all text  elements:Note: As a
    presentation attribute, direction  can be used as a CSS property.
    See css direction for further  information.You can use this
    attribute with the following  SVG elements:BCD tables only load in

- dominantBaseline (string | number; optional):
    The dominant-baseline attribute specifies the dominant baseline,
    which is the baseline used to align the box's text and
    inline-level contents. It also indicates the default alignment
    baseline of any boxes participating in baseline alignment  in the
    box's alignment context.It is used to determine  or re-determine a
    scaled-baseline-table. A scaled-baseline-table  is a compound
    value with three components:Some values  of the property
    re-determine all three values. Others  only re-establish the
    baseline-table font-size. When the  initial value, auto, would
    give an undesired result, this  property can be used to explicitly
    set the desired scaled-baseline-table.If  there is no baseline
    table in the nominal font, or if  the baseline table lacks an
    entry for the desired baseline,  then the browser may use
    heuristics to determine the position  of the desired
    baseline.Note: As a presentation attribute,  dominant-baseline can
    be used as a CSS property.You can  use this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:If  this property occurs on a <text>
    element, then the computed  value depends on the value of the
    writing-mode attribute.If  the writing-mode is horizontal, then
    the value of the  dominant-baseline component is alphabetic.
    Otherwise,  if the writing-mode is vertical, then the value of the
    dominant-baseline component is central.If this property  occurs on
    a <tspan>, <tref>, <altGlyph>, or <textPath>  element, then the
    dominant-baseline and the baseline-table  components remain the
    same as those of the parent text  content element.If the computed
    baseline-shift value actually  shifts the baseline, then the
    baseline-table font-size  component is set to the value of the
    font-size attribute  on the element on which the dominant-baseline
    attribute  occurs, otherwise the baseline-table font-size remains
    the same as that of the element.If there is no parent  text
    content element, the scaled-baseline-table value  is constructed
    as above for <text> elements.The dominant-baseline  and the
    baseline-table components are set by determining  the predominant
    script of the character data content.  The writing-mode, whether
    horizontal or vertical, is used  to select the appropriate set of
    baseline-tables and the  dominant baseline is used to select the
    baseline-table  that corresponds to that baseline. The
    baseline-table  font-size component is set to the value of the
    font-size  attribute on the element on which the dominant-baseline
    attribute occurs.The dominant-baseline, the baseline-table,  and
    the baseline-table font-size remain the same as that  of the
    parent text content element.The dominant-baseline  and the
    baseline-table remain the same, but the baseline-table  font-size
    is changed to the value of the font-size attribute  on this
    element. This re-scales the baseline-table for  the current
    font-size.The baseline-identifier for the  dominant-baseline is
    set to be ideographic, the derived  baseline-table is constructed
    using the ideographic baseline-table  in the font, and the
    baseline-table font-size is changed  to the value of the font-size
    attribute on this element.The  baseline-identifier for the
    dominant-baseline is set to  be alphabetic, the derived
    baseline-table is constructed  using the alphabetic baseline-table
    in the font, and the  baseline-table font-size is changed to the
    value of the  font-size attribute on this element.The
    baseline-identifier  for the dominant-baseline is set to be
    hanging, the derived  baseline-table is constructed using the
    hanging baseline-table  in the font, and the baseline-table
    font-size is changed  to the value of the font-size attribute on
    this element.The  baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is
    set to  be mathematical, the derived baseline-table is constructed
    using the mathematical baseline-table in the font, and  the
    baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of  the font-size
    attribute on this element.The baseline-identifier  for the
    dominant-baseline is set to be central. The derived
    baseline-table is constructed from the defined baselines  in a
    baseline-table in the font. That font baseline-table  is chosen
    using the following priority order of baseline-table  names:
    ideographic, alphabetic, hanging, mathematical.  The
    baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of  the font-size
    attribute on this element.The baseline-identifier  for the
    dominant-baseline is set to be middle. The derived  baseline-table
    is constructed from the defined baselines  in a baseline-table in
    the font. That font baseline-table  is chosen using the following
    priority order of baseline-table  names: alphabetic, ideographic,
    hanging, mathematical.  The baseline-table font-size is changed to
    the value of  the font-size attribute on this element.The
    baseline-identifier  for the dominant-baseline is set to be
    text-after-edge.  The derived baseline-table is constructed from
    the defined  baselines in a baseline-table in the font. The choice
    of which font baseline-table to use from the baseline-tables  in
    the font is browser dependent. The baseline-table font-size  is
    changed to the value of the font-size attribute on  this
    element.The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline  is set
    to be text-before-edge. The derived baseline-table  is constructed
    from the defined baselines in a baseline-table  in the font. The
    choice of which baseline-table to use  from the baseline-tables in
    the font is browser dependent.  The baseline-table font-size is
    changed to the value of  the font-size attribute on this
    element.This value uses  the top of the em box as the baseline.BCD

    position  of an element or its content.You can use this attribute
    with the following SVG elements:Warning: As of SVG2 <altGlyph>  is
    deprecated and shouldn't be used.For <altGlyph>, if  it contains a
    single value, dx defines a shift along the  x-axis for all

- fill (string; optional):
    fill color.

- fillOpacity (string | number; optional):
    The fill-opacity attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the opacity of the paint server (color, gradient, pattern,  etc)
    applied to a shape.Note: As a presentation attribute  fill-opacity
    can be used as a CSS property.You can use  this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:Note: SVG2  introduces percentage values
    for fill-opacity, however,  it is not widely supported yet (See
    Browser compatibility  below) as a consequence, it is best
    practices to set opacity  with a value in the range [0-1].BCD

- fillRule (a value equal to: "evenodd", "inherit", "nonzero"; optional):
    The fill-rule attribute is a presentation attribute defining  the
    algorithm to use to determine the inside part of a  shape.Note: As
    a presentation attribute, fill-rule can  be used as a CSS
    property.You can use this attribute with  the following SVG
    elements:The fill-rule attribute provides  two options for how the
    inside (that is, the area to be  filled) of a shape is
    determined:The value nonzero determines  the \"insideness\" of a
    point in the shape by drawing a  ray from that point to infinity
    in any direction, and  then examining the places where a segment
    of the shape  crosses the ray. Starting with a count of zero, add
    one  each time a path segment crosses the ray from left to  right
    and subtract one each time a path segment crosses  the ray from
    right to left. After counting the crossings,  if the result is
    zero then the point is outside the path.  Otherwise, it is
    inside.The value evenodd determines the  \"insideness\" of a point
    in the shape by drawing a ray  from that point to infinity in any
    direction and counting  the number of path segments from the given
    shape that  the ray crosses. If this number is odd, the point is
    inside;  if even, the point is outside.BCD tables only load in

    ratio (ratio of x-height to font size) of the first  choice
    font-family. This means that the first-choice font,  when
    available, will appear the same size in browsers,  whether or not

- glyphOrientationHorizontal (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The glyph-orientation-horizontal  attribute affects the
    amount that the current text position  advances as each glyph is
    rendered.When the reference  orientation direction is horizontal
    and the glyph-orientation-horizontal  results in an orientation
    angle that is a multiple of  180 degrees, then the current text
    position is incremented  according to the horizontal metrics of
    the glyph. Otherwise,  if the value of this attribute is not a
    multiple of 180  degrees, then the current text position is
    incremented  according to the vertical metrics of the glyph.This
    attribute  is applied only to text written in a horizontal
    writing-mode.Note:  As a presentation attribute,
    glyph-orientation-horizontal  can be used as a CSS property.You
    can use this attribute  with the following SVG elements:       The
    value of the  angle is restricted to 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.
    If  another angle is specified, it is rounded to the closest  of
    the permitted values.       A value of 0deg indicates  that all
    glyphs are set with the top of the glyphs oriented  towards the
    reference orientation. A value of 90deg indicates  an orientation
    of 90 degrees clockwise from the reference  orientation.     BCD

    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your

    time.The glyph-orientation-vertical  attribute affects the amount
    that hte current text position  advances as each glyph is
    rendered.When the inline-progression-direction  is vertical and
    the glyph-orientation-vertical results  in an orientation angle
    that is a multiple of 180 degrees,  then the current text position
    is incremented according  to the vertical metrics of the glyph.
    Otherwise, if the  angle is not a multiple of 180 degrees, then
    the current  text position is incremented according to the
    horizontal  metrics of the glyph.This attribute is applied only to
    text written in a vertical writing-mode.Note: As a presentation
    attribute, glyph-orientation-vertical can be used as a  CSS
    property.You can use this attribute with the following  SVG
    elements:Fullwidth ideographic and fullwidth Latin  text will be
    set with a glyph orientation of 0 degrees.  Ideographic
    punctuation and other ideographic characters  having alternate
    horizontal and vertical forms will use  the vertical form of the
    glyph. Text which is not fullwidth  will be set with a glyph
    orientation of 90 degrees.This  reorientation rule applies only to
    the first-level non-ideographic  text. All further embedding of
    writing modes or bidirectional  processing will be based on the
    first-level rotation.Note:  Text set in this \"rotated\" manner
    may contain ligatures  or other glyph combining and reordering
    common to the  language and script. (This presentation form does
    not  disable auto-ligature formation or similar context-driven
    variations.)The determination of which characters should  be
    auto-rotated may vary across user agents. The determination  is
    based on a complex interaction between country, language,  script,
    character properties, font, and character context.        The
    value of the angle is restricted to 0, 90, 180,  and 270 degrees.
    If another angle is specified, it is  rounded to the closest of
    the permitted values.        A value of 0deg indicates that all
    glyphs are set with  the top of the glyphs oriented towards the
    reference orientation.  A value of 90deg indicates an orientation
    of 90 degrees  clockwise from the reference orientation.     BCD

- kerning (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The kerning attribute indicates  whether the spacing between
    glyphs should be adjusted  based on kerning tables that are
    included in the relevant  font (i.e., enable auto-kerning) or
    instead disable auto-kerning  and set the spacing between them to
    a specific length  (typically, zero).Note: As a presentation
    attribute kerning  can be used as a CSS property. In CSS the
    property is  called font-kerning, though.You can use this
    attribute  with the following SVG elements:This value indicates
    that  the spacing between glyphs is adjusted based on kerning
    tables that are included in the font that will be used.If  a
    length is provided, then auto-kerning is disabled. Instead,
    inter-character spacing is set to the given length.If  a length is
    provided without a unit identifier (e.g.,  an unqualified number
    such as 128), the length is processed  as a width value in the
    current user coordinate system.  If a unit identifier (e.g.,
    0.25em or 1%) is provided,  then the length is converted into a
    corresponding value  in the current user coordinate system.The
    most common  scenario, other than auto, is to set kerning to a
    value  of 0 so that auto-kerning is disabled.The given length  is
    added to the inter-character spacing value specified  by the
    letter-spacing attribute.BCD tables only load in  the browser with

- letterSpacing (string | number; optional):
    The letter-spacing attribute controls spacing between text
    characters,  in addition to any spacing from the kerning
    attribute.If  the attribute value is a unitless number (like 128),
    the  browser processes it as a <length> in the current user
    coordinate system.If the attribute value has a unit identifier,
    such as .25em or 1%, then the browser converts the <length>  into
    its corresponding value in the current user coordinate
    system.Note: As a presentation attribute, letter-spacing  can be
    used as a CSS property. See the css letter-spacing  property for

- loading_state (dict; optional):
    Object that holds the loading state object coming from
    dash-renderer.

    `loading_state` is a dict with keys:

    - component_name (string; optional):
        Holds the name of the component that is loading.

    - is_loading (boolean; optional):
        Determines if the component is loading or not.

    - prop_name (string; optional):
        Holds which property is loading.

- n_clicks (number; default 0):
    An integer that represents the number of times that this element
    has been clicked on.

- n_clicks_timestamp (number; default -1):
    An integer that represents the time (in ms since 1970) at which
    n_clicks changed. This can be used to tell which button was
    changed most recently.

- opacity (string | number; optional):
    The opacity attribute specifies the transparency of an object  or
    of a group of objects, that is, the degree to which  the
    background behind the element is overlaid.Note: As  a presentation
    attribute, opacity can be used as a CSS  property. See the css
    opacity property for more information.You  can use this attribute
    with the following SVG elements:The  uniform opacity setting to be
    applied across an entire  object, as a <number>. Any values
    outside the range 0.0  (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque)
    will be clamped  to this range.BCD tables only load in the browser

    painted.Note: As a presentation attribute, paint-order  can be
    used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the
    following SVG elements:This value indicates that  the fill will be
    painted first, then the stroke, and finally  the markers.The order
    of these three keywords indicates  the order in which the painting
    happens, from left to  right. If any of the three painting
    components is omitted,  they will be painted in their default
    order after the  specified components. For example, using stroke
    is equivalent  to stroke fill markers.The example would be
    rendered as  follows:    The stroke under effect could be achieved
    via the following CSS property:BCD tables only load in  the

    allows defining whether or when an element may be the  target of a
    mouse event.Note: As a presentation attribute  pointer-events can
    be used as a CSS property.You can use  this attribute with the

- requiredFeatures (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The requiredFeatures attribute  takes a list of feature
    strings, with the individual strings  separated by white space. It
    determines whether or not  all of the named features are supported
    by the browser;  if all of them are supported, the attribute
    evaluates  to True end the element is rendered; otherwise, the
    attribute  evaluates to False and the current element and its
    children  are skipped and thus will not be rendered. This provides
    a way to design SVG that gracefully falls back when features
    aren't available.If the attribute is not present, then  its
    implicit evaluated value is True. If a None string  or empty
    string value is given to attribute requiredFeatures,  the
    attribute is evaluate to False.requiredFeatures is  often used in
    conjunction with the <switch> element. If  requiredFeatures is
    used in other situations, it represents  a simple switch on the
    given element whether to render  the element or not.To detect
    availability of an SVG feature  from script, there is the (also
    deprecated) DOMImplementation.hasFeature()  method.You can use
    this attribute with the following SVG  elements:This is a list of
    feature strings, separated  using white space. Determines whether
    all of the named  features are supported by the browser. See
    Feature strings  below for a list of allowed values.The following
    are the  feature strings for the requiredFeatures attribute. These
    same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call  that is
    part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation
    interface. In some cases the feature strings map directly  to a
    set of attributes, properties or elements, in others  they
    represent some functionality of the browser. Note  that the format
    and naming for feature strings changed  from SVG 1.0 to SVG 1.1.
    The SVG 1.0 feature strings are  not listed here but can be found
    in the SVG Specification.  Some browser support SVG 1.0 Feature
    strings for compatibility  reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature

- strokeDasharray (string | number; optional):
    The stroke-dasharray attribute is a presentation attribute
    defining  the pattern of dashes and gaps used to paint the outline
    of the shape;Note: As a presentation attribute, stroke-dasharray
    can be used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the

    defining  an offset on the rendering of the associated dash
    array.Note:  As a presentation attribute stroke-dashoffset can be
    used  as a CSS property.You can use this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:The offset is usually expressed  in user
    units resolved against the pathLength but if a  <percentage> is

- strokeLinecap (a value equal to: "butt", "inherit", "round", "square"; optional):
    The stroke-linecap attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the shape to be used at the end of open subpaths when  they are
    stroked.Note: As a presentation attribute stroke-linecap  can be
    used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the
    following SVG elements:The butt value indicates  that the stroke
    for each subpath does not extend beyond  its two endpoints. On a
    zero length subpath, the path  will not be rendered at all.The
    round value indicates  that at the end of each subpath the stroke
    will be extended  by a half circle with a diameter equal to the
    stroke width.  On a zero length subpath, the stroke consists of a
    full  circle centered at the subpath's point.The square value
    indicates that at the end of each subpath the stroke will  be
    extended by a rectangle with a width equal to half  the width of
    the stroke and a height equal to the width  of the stroke. On a
    zero length subpath, the stroke consists  of a square with its
    width equal to the stroke width,  centered at the subpath's

- strokeLinejoin (a value equal to: "bevel", "inherit", "miter", "round"; optional):
    The stroke-linejoin attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the shape to be used at the corners of paths when they  are
    stroked.Note: As a presentation attribute stroke-linejoin  can be
    used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the
    following SVG elements:Note: The arcs value as  been introduced in
    SVG2 and it isn't widely supported  yet, see Browser compatibility
    below for details.The arcs  value indicates that an arcs corner is
    to be used to join  path segments. The arcs shape is formed by
    extending the  outer edges of the stroke at the join point with
    arcs  that have the same curvature as the outer edges at the  join
    point.The bevel value indicates that a bevelled corner  is to be
    used to join path segments.The miter value indicates  that a sharp
    corner is to be used to join path segments.  The corner is formed
    by extending the outer edges of the  stroke at the tangents of the
    path segments until they  intersect.Note: If the stroke-miterlimit
    is exceeded,  the line join falls back to bevel.Note: the
    miter-clip  value as been introduced in SVG2 and it isn't widely
    supported  yet, see Browser compatibility below for details.The
    miter-clip  value indicates that a sharp corner is to be used to
    join  path segments. The corner is formed by extending the outer
    edges of the stroke at the tangents of the path segments  until
    they intersect.If the stroke-miterlimit is exceeded,  the miter is
    clipped at a distance equal to half the stroke-miterlimit  value
    multiplied by the stroke width from the intersection  of the path
    segments. This provides a better rendering  than miter on very
    sharp join or in case of an animation.The  round value indicates
    that a round corner is to be used  to join path segments.BCD

- strokeMiterlimit (string | number; optional):
    The stroke-miterlimit attribute is a presentation attribute
    defining  a limit on the ratio of the miter length to the
    stroke-width  used to draw a miter join. When the limit is
    exceeded,  the join is converted from a miter to a bevel.Note: As
    a presentation attribute stroke-miterlimit can be used  as a CSS
    property.You can use this attribute with the  following SVG
    elements:When two line segments meet at  a sharp angle and miter
    joins have been specified for  stroke-linejoin, it is possible for
    the miter to extend  far beyond the thickness of the line stroking
    the path.  The stroke-miterlimit ratio is used to define when the
    limit is exceeded, if so the join is converted from a  miter to a
    bevel.The ratio of miter length (distance between  the outer tip
    and the inner corner of the miter) to stroke-width  is directly
    related to the angle (theta) between the segments  in user space
    by the formula:               stroke-miterlimit        =
    miterLength                              stroke-width

    )                                                  For example, a
    miter  limit of 1.414 converts miters to bevels for theta less
    than 90 degrees, a limit of 4.0 converts them for theta  less than
    approximately 29 degrees, and a limit of 10.0  converts them for
    theta less than approximately 11.5 degrees.The  value of
    stroke-miterlimit must be greater than or equal  to 1.BCD tables

- strokeOpacity (string | number; optional):
    The stroke-opacity attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the opacity of the paint server (color, gradient, pattern,  etc)
    applied to the stroke of a shape.Note: As a presentation
    attribute stroke-opacity can be used as a CSS property.You  can
    use this attribute with the following SVG elements:Note:  SVG2
    introduces percentage values for stroke-opacity,  however, it is
    not widely supported yet (See Browser compatibility  below) as a
    consequence, it is best practices to set opacity  with a value in
    the range [0-1].It's important to know  that the stroke partially
    covers the fill of a shape,  so a stroke with an opacity different
    than 1 will partially  show the fill underneath. To avoid this
    effect, it is  possible to apply a global opacity with the opacity
    attribute  or to put the stroke behind the fill with the
    paint-order  attribute.BCD tables only load in the browser with

    The stroke-width attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the width of the stroke to be applied to the shape.You  can use
    this attribute with the following SVG elements:Note:  A percentage
    value is always computed as a percentage  of the normalized

- style (dict with strings as keys and values of type string | number; optional):
    CSS style to apply to the element.

- systemLanguage (string | number; optional):
    The systemLanguage attribute represents a list of supported
    language  tags. This list is matched against the language defined
    in the user preferences.You can use this attribute with  the
    following SVG elements:The value is a set of comma-separated
    tokens, each of which must be a language tag, as defined  in RFC
    5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known  as BCP
    47).systemLanguage is often used in conjunction  with the <switch>
    element. If the attribute is used in  other situations, then it
    represents a simple switch on  the given element whether to render
    the element or not.Note:  If several alternative language objects
    are enclosed in  a <switch> and none of them matches, this may
    lead to  situations where no content is displayed. It is thus
    recommended  to include a \"catch-all\" choice at the end of such
    a <switch>  which is acceptable in all cases.The attribute
    evaluates  to \"True\" if one of the language tags indicated by
    user  preferences is a case-insensitive match or prefix (followed
    by a \"-\") of one of the language tags given in the value  of
    this parameter. Otherwise it evaluates to \"False\".Note:  The
    prefix matching rule does not imply that if a user  understands a
    language with a certain tag, that the user  will also understand
    all languages with the tag as prefix.If  the attribute is not
    present, then it implicitly evaluates  to \"True\". If a None
    string or empty string value is given,  the attribute evaluates to
    \"False\".The prefix rule allows  the use of prefix tags if this
    is the case.Multiple languages  may be listed for content that is
    intended for multiple  audiences. For example, content that is
    presented simultaneously  in the original Maori and English
    versions, would call  for:However, just because multiple languages
    are present  within the object on which the systemLanguage test
    attribute  is placed, this does not mean that it is intended for
    multiple linguistic audiences. An example would be a beginner's
    language primer, such as \"A First Lesson in Latin,\" which  is
    clearly intended to be used by an English-literate  audience. In
    this case, the attribute should only include  en.BCD tables only

- textAnchor (string; optional):
    The text-anchor attribute is used to align (start-, middle- or
    end-alignment) a string of pre-formatted text or auto-wrapped
    text where the wrapping area is determined from the inline-size
    property relative to a given point.This attribute is not
    applicable to other types of auto-wrapped text. For those  cases
    you should use text-align. For multi-line text,  the alignment
    takes place for each line.The text-anchor  attribute is applied to
    each individual text chunk within  a given <text> element. Each
    text chunk has an initial  current text position, which represents
    the point in the  user coordinate system resulting from (depending
    on context)  application of the x and y attributes on the <text>
    element,  any x or y attribute values on a <tspan>, <tref> or
    <altGlyph>  element assigned explicitly to the first rendered
    character  in a text chunk, or determination of the initial
    current  text position for a <textPath> element.Note: As a
    presentation  attribute, text-anchor can be used as a CSS
    property.You  can use this attribute with the following SVG
    elements:The  rendered characters are aligned such that the start
    of  the text string is at the initial current text position.  For
    an element with a direction property value of ltr  (typical for
    most European languages), the left side of  the text is rendered
    at the initial text position. For  an element with a direction
    property value of rtl (typical  for Arabic and Hebrew), the right
    side of the text is  rendered at the initial text position. For an
    element  with a vertical primary text direction (often typical
    for Asian text), the top side of the text is rendered  at the
    initial text position.The rendered characters are  aligned such
    that the middle of the text string is at  the current text
    position. (For text on a path, conceptually  the text string is
    first laid out in a straight line.  The midpoint between the start
    of the text string and  the end of the text string is determined.
    Then, the text  string is mapped onto the path with this midpoint
    placed  at the current text position.)The rendered characters  are
    shifted such that the end of the resulting rendered  text (final
    current text position before applying the  text-anchor property)
    is at the initial current text position.  For an element with a
    direction property value of ltr  (typical for most European
    languages), the right side  of the text is rendered at the initial
    text position.  For an element with a direction property value of
    rtl  (typical for Arabic and Hebrew), the left side of the  text
    is rendered at the initial text position. For an  element with a
    vertical primary text direction (often  typical for Asian text),
    the bottom of the text is rendered  at the initial text
    position.BCD tables only load in the  browser with JavaScript

- textDecoration (string | number; optional):
    The text-decoration attribute defines whether text is decorated
    with an underline, overline and/or strike-through. It  is a
    shorthand for the text-decoration-line and text-decoration-style
    properties.The fill and stroke of the text decoration  are given
    by the fill and stroke of the text at the point  where the text
    decoration is declared.The paint order  of the text decoration,
    i.e. the fill and stroke, is determined  by the value of the
    paint-order attribute at the point  where the text decoration is
    declared.Note: As a presentation  attribute, text-decoration can
    be used as a CSS property.  See the css text-decoration property
    for more information.You  can use this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:For  a description of the values, please
    refer to the CSS text-decoration  property.BCD tables only load in

- textLength (string | number; optional):
    The textLength attribute, available on SVG <text> and <tspan>
    elements, lets you specify the width of the space into  which the
    text will draw. The user agent will ensure that  the text does not
    extend farther than that distance, using  the method or methods
    specified by the lengthAdjust attribute.  By default, only the
    spacing between characters is adjusted,  but the glyph size can
    also be adjusted if you change  lengthAdjust.By using textLength,
    you can ensure that  your SVG text displays at the same width
    regardless of  conditions including web fonts failing to load (or
    not  having loaded yet).You can use this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:This value specifies the width  of the
    space the text will be adjusted to occupy as absolute  length or
    percentage.A numeric value outlines a length  referring to the
    units of the current coordinate system.Let's  create a simple
    example that presents text you can resize  using an <input>
    element of type \"range\".Let's start with  the SVG. It's pretty
    basic, with a 1000-by-300 pixel space  mapped into a 10 centimeter
    by 3 centimeter box.First,  a <rect> element is used to create and
    stroke a rectangle  to contain the text. Then <text> is used to
    create the  text element itself, with an id of \"hello\".The HTML
    is  also simple, with only two displayed elements contained
    inside a grouping <div>:The <input> element, of type \"range\",
    is used to create the slider control the user will manipulate  to
    change the width of the text. A <span> element of ID
    \"widthDisplay\" is provided to display the current width
    value.Finally, let's have a look at the JavaScript code.  It
    starts by stashing references to the elements it will  need to
    access, using Document.getElementById():After  fetching the
    element references, an EventListener is established  by calling
    addEventListener() on the slider control, to  receive any input
    events which occur. These events will  be sent any time the
    slider's value changes, even if the  user hasn't stopped moving
    it, so we can responsively  adjust the text width.When an
    \"input\" event occurs, we  call newValueSpecifiedUnits() to set
    the value of textLength  to the slider's new value, using the
    SVGLength interface's  SVG_LENGTHTYPE_PX unit type to indicate
    that the value  represents pixels. Note that we have to dive into
    textLength  to get its baseVal property; textLength is stored as
    an  SVGLength object, so we can't treat it like a plain
    number.After  updating the text width, the contents of the
    widthDisplay  box are updated with the new value as well, and
    we're  finished.Here's what the example looks like. Try dragging
    the slider around to get a feel for what it does.BCD tables  only

- transform (string; optional):
    Transformation to apply to the element.

- unicodeBidi (string | number; optional):
    The unicode-bidi attribute specifies how the accumulation of  the
    background image is managed.Note: As a presentation  attribute,
    unicode-bidi can be used as a CSS property.  See the CSS
    unicode-bidi property for more information.You  can use this
    attribute with the following SVG elements:For  a description of
    the values, please refer to the CSS unicode-bidi  property.BCD

- vectorEffect (string | number; optional):
    The vector-effect property specifies the vector effect to use
    when drawing an object. Vector effects are applied before  any of
    the other compositing operations, i.e. filters,  masks and
    clips.Note: As a presentation attribute, vector-effect  can be
    used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the
    following SVG elements:This value specifies that  no vector effect
    shall be applied, i.e. the default rendering  behavior is used
    which is to first fill the geometry of  a shape with a specified
    paint, then stroke the outline  with a specified paint.This value
    modifies the way an  object is stroked. Normally stroking involves
    calculating  stroke outline of the shape's path in current user
    coordinate  system and filling that outline with the stroke paint
    (color or gradient). The resulting visual effect of this  value is
    that the stroke width is not dependent on the  transformations of
    the element (including non-uniform  scaling and shear
    transformations) and zoom level.This  value specifies a special
    user coordinate system used  by the element and its descendants.
    The scale of that  user coordinate system does not change in spite
    of any  transformation changes from a host coordinate space.
    However,  it does not specify the suppression of rotation and
    skew.  Also, it does not specify the origin of the user coordinate
    system. Since this value suppresses scaling of the user
    coordinate system, it also has the characteristics of
    non-scaling-stroke.This value specifies a special user  coordinate
    system used by the element and its descendants.  The rotation and
    skew of that user coordinate system is  suppressed in spite of any
    transformation changes from  a host coordinate space. However, it
    does not specify  the suppression of scaling. Also, it does not
    specify  the origin of user coordinate system.This value specifies
    a special user coordinate system used by the element and  its
    descendants. The position of user coordinate system  is fixed in
    spite of any transformation changes from a  host coordinate space.
    However, it does not specify the  suppression of rotation, skew
    and scaling. When this vector  effect and the transform property
    are defined at the same  time, that property is consumed for this
    effect.BCD tables  only load in the browser with JavaScript

- visibility (string | number; optional):
    The visibility attribute lets you control the visibility of
    graphical  elements. With a value of hidden or collapse the
    current  graphics element is invisible.Note: If the visibility
    attribute is set to hidden on a text element, then the  text is
    invisible but still takes up space in text layout
    calculations.Depending on the value of attribute pointer-events,
    graphics elements which have their visibility attribute  set to
    hidden still might receive events.Note: As a presentation
    attribute, visibility can be used as a CSS property. See  the css
    visibility property for more information.You can  use this
    attribute with the following SVG elements:The  following example
    toggles the CSS visibility of the SVG  image path.This value
    indicates that the element will  be painted.This value indicates
    that the element will  not be painted. Though it is still part of
    the rendering  tree, i.e. it may receive pointer events depending
    on  the pointer-events attribute, may receive focus depending  on
    the tabindex attribute, contributes to bounding box  calculations
    and clipping paths, and does affect text  layout.This value is
    equal to hidden.BCD tables only load  in the browser with

- wordSpacing (string | number; optional):
    The word-spacing attribute specifies spacing behavior between
    words.If a <length> is provided without a unit identifier  (e.g.
    an unqualified number such as 128), the browser  processes the
    <length> as a width value in the current  user coordinate
    system.If a <length> is provided with  one of the unit identifiers
    (e.g. .25em or 1%), then the  browser converts the <length> into a
    corresponding value  in the current user coordinate system.Note:
    As a presentation  attribute, word-spacing can be used as a CSS
    property.  See the css word-spacing property for more
    information.You  can use this attribute with the following SVG
    elements:For  a description of the values, please refer to the CSS
    letter-spacing  property.BCD tables only load in the browser with

- writingMode (string | number; optional):
    The writing-mode attribute specifies whether the initial
    inline-progression-direction  for a <text> element shall be
    left-to-right, right-to-left,  or top-to-bottom. The writing-mode
    attribute applies only  to <text> elements; the attribute is
    ignored for <tspan>,  <tref>, <altGlyph> and <textPath>
    sub-elements. (Note  that the inline-progression-direction can
    change within  a <text> element due to the Unicode bidirectional
    algorithm  and properties direction and unicode-bidi.)Note: As a
    presentation attribute, writing-mode can be used as a  CSS
    property. See the CSS writing-mode property for more
    information.You can use this attribute with the following  SVG
    elements:This value defines a top-to-bottom block  flow direction.
    Both the writing mode and the typographic  mode are
    horizontal.This value defines a right-to-left  block flow
    direction. Both the writing mode and the typographic  mode are
