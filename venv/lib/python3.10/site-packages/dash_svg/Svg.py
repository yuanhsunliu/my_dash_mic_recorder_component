Keyword arguments:

- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):
    The children of this component.

- id (string; optional):
    The ID of this component, used to identify dash components in
    callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components
    in an app.

- alt (string; optional):
    Alternative text in case an image can't be displayed.

- aria-* (string; optional):
    A wildcard aria attribute.

- baseProfile (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The baseProfile attribute  describes the minimum SVG language
    profile that the author  believes is necessary to correctly render
    the content.  The attribute does not specify any processing
    restrictions;  It can be considered metadata.For example, the
    value of  the attribute could be used by an authoring tool to warn
    the user when they are modifying the document beyond the  scope of
    the specified base profile.Each SVG profile should  define the
    text that is appropriate for this attribute.You  can use this
    attribute with the following SVG elements:Last  modified: May 13,

- className (string; optional):
    Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.

- clip (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The clip attribute is a  presentation attribute defining the
    visible region of  an element.This attribute has the same
    parameter values  as defined for the css clip property. Unitless
    values,  which indicate current user coordinates, are permitted
    on the coordinate values on the rect(). The value of auto  defines
    a clipping path along the bounds of the viewport  created by the
    given element.You can use this attribute  with the following SVG
    elements:Warning: This property  is deprecated. Use clip-path
    instead.The value auto defines  a clipping path along the bounds
    of the viewport created  by the given element. The value rect()
    defines a clipping  rectangle following the following syntax:
    rect(<top>,  <right>, <bottom>, <left>). The <top> and <bottom>
    values  specify offsets from the top border edge of the element
    viewport, while <right> and <left> specify offsets from  the left
    border edge of the element viewport.BCD tables  only load in the

- clipPath (string; optional):
    The clip-path presentation attribute defines or associates a
    clipping path with the element it is related to.Note:  As a
    presentation attribute clip-path can be used as a  CSS
    property.You can use this attribute with the following  SVG
    elements:An extra information to tell how a <basic-shape>  is
    applied to an element: fill-box indicates to use the  object
    bounding box; stroke-box indicates to use the object  bounding box
    extended with the stroke; view-box indicates  to use the nearest
    SVG viewport as the reference box.Note:  For more details on the
    clip-path syntax, see the CSS  property clip-path reference

- colorInterpolation (string | number; optional):
    The color-interpolation attribute specifies the color space for
    gradient interpolations, color animations, and alpha
    compositing.Note:  For filter effects, the
    color-interpolation-filters property  controls which color space
    is used.The color-interpolation  property chooses between color
    operations occurring in  the sRGB color space or in a (light
    energy linear) linearized  RGB color space. Having chosen the
    appropriate color space,  component-wise linear interpolation is
    used.When a child  element is blended into a background, the value
    of the  color-interpolation property on the child determines the
    type of blending, not the value of the color-interpolation  on the
    parent. For gradients which make use of the href  or the
    deprecated xlink:href attribute to reference another  gradient,
    the gradient uses the property's value from  the gradient element
    which is directly referenced by the  fill or stroke property. When
    animating colors, color  interpolation is performed according to
    the value of the  color-interpolation property on the element
    being animated.Note:  As a presentation attribute,
    color-interpolation can be  used as a CSS property.You can use
    this attribute with  the following SVG elements:Indicates that the
    user agent  can choose either the sRGB or linearRGB spaces for
    color  interpolation. This option indicates that the author
    doesn't  require that color interpolation occur in a particular
    color space.Indicates that color interpolation should  occur in
    the sRGB color space.Indicates that color interpolation  should
    occur in the linearized RGB color space as described  in the sRGB
    specification.BCD tables only load in the  browser with JavaScript

- data-* (string; optional):
    A wildcard data attribute.

- enableBackground (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The enable-background attribute  specifies how the
    accumulation of the background image  is managed.Note: As a
    presentation attribute, enable-background  can be used as a CSS
    property.You can use this attribute  with the following SVG
    elements:If an ancestor container  element has a property value of
    enable-background: new,  then all graphics elements within the
    current container  element are rendered both onto the parent
    container element's  background image canvas and onto the target
    device.Otherwise,  there is no current background image canvas, so
    graphics  elements are only rendered onto the target device.This
    value enables the ability of children of the current container
    element to access the background image.It also indicates  that a
    new (i.e., initially transparent black) background  image canvas
    is established and that in effect all children  of the current
    container element shall be rendered into  the new background image
    canvas in addition to being rendered  onto the target device.
    The optional <x>, <y>, <width>,  and <height> parameters are
    <number> values that indicate  the subregion of the container
    element's user space where  access to the background image is
    allowed to happen. Those  values act as a clipping rectangle on
    the background image  canvas.       Negative values for <width> or
    <height>  are forbidden. If one, two, or three values are
    specified  or if neither <width> nor <height> are specified, the
    BackgroundImage and BackgroundAlpha of a filter primitive  are
    processed as if background image processing were not  enabled.

- mask (string; optional):
    The mask attribute is a presentation attribute mainly used to
    bind a given <mask> element with the element the attribute
    belongs to.Note: As a presentation attribute mask can  be used as
    a CSS property.You can use this attribute with  the following SVG
    elements:Since SVG2, the mask attribute  is defined as a css
    property and is a shorthand for many  other properties:
    mask-image, mask-mode, mask-repeat,  mask-position, mask-clip,
    mask-origin, mask-size, and  mask-composite.BCD tables only load

- n_clicks (number; default 0):
    An integer that represents the number of times that this element
    has been clicked on.

- n_clicks_timestamp (number; default -1):
    An integer that represents the time (in ms since 1970) at which
    n_clicks changed. This can be used to tell which button was
    changed most recently.

- opacity (string | number; optional):
    The opacity attribute specifies the transparency of an object  or
    of a group of objects, that is, the degree to which  the
    background behind the element is overlaid.Note: As  a presentation
    attribute, opacity can be used as a CSS  property. See the css
    opacity property for more information.You  can use this attribute
    with the following SVG elements:The  uniform opacity setting to be
    applied across an entire  object, as a <number>. Any values
    outside the range 0.0  (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque)
    will be clamped  to this range.BCD tables only load in the browser

- overflow (string | number; optional):
    The overflow attribute sets what to do when an element's content
    is too big to fit in its block formatting context. This  feature
    is not widely implemented yet.This attribute has  the same
    parameter values and meaning as the css overflow  property,
    however, the following additional points apply:Note:  Although the
    initial value for overflow is auto, it is  overwritten in the User
    Agent style sheet for the <svg>  element when it is not the root
    element of a stand-alone  document, the <pattern> element, and the
    <marker> element  to be hidden by default.Note: As a presentation
    attribute,  overflow can be used as a CSS property. See the CSS
    overflow  property for more information.You can use this attribute
    with the following SVG elements:For a description of the  values,
    please see the css overflow property.BCD tables  only load in the

- pointerEvents (string | number; optional):
    The pointer-events attribute is a presentation attribute that
    allows defining whether or when an element may be the  target of a
    mouse event.Note: As a presentation attribute  pointer-events can
    be used as a CSS property.You can use  this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:For a detailed  explanation of each
    possible value, have a look at the  CSS pointer-events
    documentation.BCD tables only load  in the browser with JavaScript

- preserveAspectRatio (string; optional):
    The preserveAspectRatio attribute indicates how an element with  a
    viewBox providing a given aspect ratio must fit into  a viewport
    with a different aspect ratio.Because the aspect  ratio of an SVG
    image is defined by the viewBox attribute,  if this attribute
    isn't set, the preserveAspectRatio attribute  has no effect (with
    one exception, the <image> element,  as described below).Its value
    is made of one or two keywords:  A required alignment value and an
    optional \"meet or slice\"  reference as described below:The
    alignment value indicates  whether to force uniform scaling and,
    if so, the alignment  method to use in case the aspect ratio of
    the viewBox  doesn't match the aspect ratio of the viewport. The
    alignment  value must be one of the following keywords:The meet or
    slice reference is optional and, if provided, must be  one of the
    following keywords:You can use this attribute  with the following
    SVG elements:For <feImage>, preserveAspectRatio  defines how the
    referenced image should fit in the rectangle  define by the
    <feImage> element.For <image>, preserveAspectRatio  defines how
    the referenced image should fit in the rectangle  define by the
    <image> element.For <marker>, preserveAspectRatio  indicates if a
    uniform scaling must be performed to fit  the element viewport.For
    <pattern>, preserveAspectRatio  indicates if a uniform scaling
    must be performed to fit  the element viewport.For <svg>,
    preserveAspectRatio indicates  if a uniform scaling must be
    performed to fit the element  viewport.For <symbol>,
    preserveAspectRatio indicates if  a uniform scaling must be
    performed to fit the element  viewport.For <view>,
    preserveAspectRatio indicates if  a uniform scaling must be
    performed to fit the element  viewport.Last modified: May 13,

- requiredFeatures (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The requiredFeatures attribute  takes a list of feature
    strings, with the individual strings  separated by white space. It
    determines whether or not  all of the named features are supported
    by the browser;  if all of them are supported, the attribute
    evaluates  to True end the element is rendered; otherwise, the
    attribute  evaluates to False and the current element and its
    children  are skipped and thus will not be rendered. This provides
    a way to design SVG that gracefully falls back when features
    aren't available.If the attribute is not present, then  its
    implicit evaluated value is True. If a None string  or empty
    string value is given to attribute requiredFeatures,  the
    attribute is evaluate to False.requiredFeatures is  often used in
    conjunction with the <switch> element. If  requiredFeatures is
    used in other situations, it represents  a simple switch on the
    given element whether to render  the element or not.To detect
    availability of an SVG feature  from script, there is the (also
    deprecated) DOMImplementation.hasFeature()  method.You can use
    this attribute with the following SVG  elements:This is a list of
    feature strings, separated  using white space. Determines whether
    all of the named  features are supported by the browser. See
    Feature strings  below for a list of allowed values.The following
    are the  feature strings for the requiredFeatures attribute. These
    same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call  that is
    part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation
    interface. In some cases the feature strings map directly  to a
    set of attributes, properties or elements, in others  they
    represent some functionality of the browser. Note  that the format
    and naming for feature strings changed  from SVG 1.0 to SVG 1.1.
    The SVG 1.0 feature strings are  not listed here but can be found
    in the SVG Specification.  Some browser support SVG 1.0 Feature
    strings for compatibility  reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature
    strings are considered  deprecated.At least one of the following

- role (string; optional):
    The ARIA role attribute.

- stroke (string; optional):
    stroke color.

- style (dict with strings as keys and values of type string | number; optional):
    CSS style to apply to the element.

- systemLanguage (string | number; optional):
    The systemLanguage attribute represents a list of supported
    language  tags. This list is matched against the language defined
    in the user preferences.You can use this attribute with  the
    following SVG elements:The value is a set of comma-separated
    tokens, each of which must be a language tag, as defined  in RFC
    5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known  as BCP
    47).systemLanguage is often used in conjunction  with the <switch>
    element. If the attribute is used in  other situations, then it
    represents a simple switch on  the given element whether to render
    the element or not.Note:  If several alternative language objects
    are enclosed in  a <switch> and none of them matches, this may
    lead to  situations where no content is displayed. It is thus
    recommended  to include a \"catch-all\" choice at the end of such
    a <switch>  which is acceptable in all cases.The attribute
    evaluates  to \"True\" if one of the language tags indicated by
    user  preferences is a case-insensitive match or prefix (followed
    by a \"-\") of one of the language tags given in the value  of
    this parameter. Otherwise it evaluates to \"False\".Note:  The
    prefix matching rule does not imply that if a user  understands a
    language with a certain tag, that the user  will also understand
    all languages with the tag as prefix.If  the attribute is not
    present, then it implicitly evaluates  to \"True\". If a None
    string or empty string value is given,  the attribute evaluates to
    \"False\".The prefix rule allows  the use of prefix tags if this
    is the case.Multiple languages  may be listed for content that is
    intended for multiple  audiences. For example, content that is
    presented simultaneously  in the original Maori and English
    versions, would call  for:However, just because multiple languages
    are present  within the object on which the systemLanguage test
    attribute  is placed, this does not mean that it is intended for
    multiple linguistic audiences. An example would be a beginner's
    language primer, such as \"A First Lesson in Latin,\" which  is
    clearly intended to be used by an English-literate  audience. In
    this case, the attribute should only include  en.BCD tables only

- viewBox (string; optional):
    The viewBox attribute defines the position and dimension, in  user

    list of four numbers: min-x, min-y, width  and height. The
    numbers, which are separated by whitespace  and/or a comma,
    specify a rectangle in user space which  is mapped to the bounds
    of the viewport established for  the associated SVG element (not
    the browser viewport).You  can use this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:The  exact effect of this attribute is
    influenced by the preserveAspectRatio  attribute.Note: Values for
    width or height lower or equal  to 0 disable rendering of the
