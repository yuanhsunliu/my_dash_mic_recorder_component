class Symbol(Component):
    """A Symbol component.
Symbol is a wrapper for the <symbol> SVG element.
For detailed attribute info see:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/symbol

Keyword arguments:

- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):
    The children of this component.

- id (string; optional):
    The ID of this component, used to identify dash components in
    callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components
    in an app.

- aria-* (string; optional):
    A wildcard aria attribute.

- className (string; optional):
    Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.

- clip (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The clip attribute is a  presentation attribute defining the
    visible region of  an element.This attribute has the same
    parameter values  as defined for the css clip property. Unitless
    values,  which indicate current user coordinates, are permitted
    on the coordinate values on the rect(). The value of auto  defines
    a clipping path along the bounds of the viewport  created by the
    given element.You can use this attribute  with the following SVG
    elements:Warning: This property  is deprecated. Use clip-path
    instead.The value auto defines  a clipping path along the bounds
    of the viewport created  by the given element. The value rect()
    defines a clipping  rectangle following the following syntax:
    rect(<top>,  <right>, <bottom>, <left>). The <top> and <bottom>
    values  specify offsets from the top border edge of the element
    viewport, while <right> and <left> specify offsets from  the left
    border edge of the element viewport.BCD tables  only load in the

- clipPath (string; optional):
    The clip-path presentation attribute defines or associates a
    clipping path with the element it is related to.Note:  As a
    presentation attribute clip-path can be used as a  CSS
    property.You can use this attribute with the following  SVG
    elements:An extra information to tell how a <basic-shape>  is
    applied to an element: fill-box indicates to use the  object
    bounding box; stroke-box indicates to use the object  bounding box
    extended with the stroke; view-box indicates  to use the nearest
    SVG viewport as the reference box.Note:  For more details on the
    clip-path syntax, see the CSS  property clip-path reference
    page.BCD tables only load  in the browser with JavaScript enabled.

- colorInterpolation (string | number; optional):
    The color-interpolation attribute specifies the color space for
    gradient interpolations, color animations, and alpha
    compositing.Note:  For filter effects, the
    color-interpolation-filters property  controls which color space
    is used.The color-interpolation  property chooses between color
    operations occurring in  the sRGB color space or in a (light
    energy linear) linearized  RGB color space. Having chosen the
    appropriate color space,  component-wise linear interpolation is
    used.When a child  element is blended into a background, the value
    of the  color-interpolation property on the child determines the
    type of blending, not the value of the color-interpolation  on the
    parent. For gradients which make use of the href  or the
    deprecated xlink:href attribute to reference another  gradient,
    the gradient uses the property's value from  the gradient element
    which is directly referenced by the  fill or stroke property. When
    animating colors, color  interpolation is performed according to
    the value of the  color-interpolation property on the element
    being animated.Note:  As a presentation attribute,
    color-interpolation can be  used as a CSS property.You can use
    this attribute with  the following SVG elements:Indicates that the
    user agent  can choose either the sRGB or linearRGB spaces for
    color  interpolation. This option indicates that the author
    doesn't  require that color interpolation occur in a particular
    color space.Indicates that color interpolation should  occur in
    the sRGB color space.Indicates that color interpolation  should
    occur in the linearized RGB color space as described  in the sRGB
    specification.BCD tables only load in the  browser with JavaScript

- data-* (string; optional):
    A wildcard data attribute.

- enableBackground (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The enable-background attribute  specifies how the
    accumulation of the background image  is managed.Note: As a
    presentation attribute, enable-background  can be used as a CSS
    property.You can use this attribute  with the following SVG
    elements:If an ancestor container  element has a property value of
    enable-background: new,  then all graphics elements within the
    current container  element are rendered both onto the parent
    container element's  background image canvas and onto the target
    device.Otherwise,  there is no current background image canvas, so
    graphics  elements are only rendered onto the target device.This
    value enables the ability of children of the current container
    element to access the background image.It also indicates  that a
    new (i.e., initially transparent black) background  image canvas
    is established and that in effect all children  of the current
    container element shall be rendered into  the new background image
    canvas in addition to being rendered  onto the target device.
    The optional <x>, <y>, <width>,  and <height> parameters are
    <number> values that indicate  the subregion of the container
    element's user space where  access to the background image is
    allowed to happen. Those  values act as a clipping rectangle on
    the background image  canvas.       Negative values for <width> or
    <height>  are forbidden. If one, two, or three values are
    specified  or if neither <width> nor <height> are specified, the
    BackgroundImage and BackgroundAlpha of a filter primitive  are
    processed as if background image processing were not  enabled.

    by React.js while rendering components See
    https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html for more info.

- loading_state (dict; optional):
    Object that holds the loading state object coming from
    dash-renderer.

    `loading_state` is a dict with keys:

        Holds which property is loading.

- mask (string; optional):
    The mask attribute is a presentation attribute mainly used to
    bind a given <mask> element with the element the attribute
    belongs to.Note: As a presentation attribute mask can  be used as
    a CSS property.You can use this attribute with  the following SVG
    elements:Since SVG2, the mask attribute  is defined as a css
    property and is a shorthand for many  other properties:
    mask-image, mask-mode, mask-repeat,  mask-position, mask-clip,
    mask-origin, mask-size, and  mask-composite.BCD tables only load

- n_clicks (number; default 0):
    An integer that represents the number of times that this element
    has been clicked on.

- n_clicks_timestamp (number; default -1):
    An integer that represents the time (in ms since 1970) at which
    n_clicks changed. This can be used to tell which button was
    changed most recently.

- opacity (string | number; optional):
    The opacity attribute specifies the transparency of an object  or
    of a group of objects, that is, the degree to which  the
    background behind the element is overlaid.Note: As  a presentation
    attribute, opacity can be used as a CSS  property. See the css
    opacity property for more information.You  can use this attribute
    with the following SVG elements:The  uniform opacity setting to be
    applied across an entire  object, as a <number>. Any values
    outside the range 0.0  (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque)
    will be clamped  to this range.BCD tables only load in the browser

- overflow (string | number; optional):
    The overflow attribute sets what to do when an element's content
    is too big to fit in its block formatting context. This  feature
    is not widely implemented yet.This attribute has  the same
    parameter values and meaning as the css overflow  property,
    however, the following additional points apply:Note:  Although the
    initial value for overflow is auto, it is  overwritten in the User
    Agent style sheet for the <svg>  element when it is not the root
    element of a stand-alone  document, the <pattern> element, and the
    <marker> element  to be hidden by default.Note: As a presentation
    attribute,  overflow can be used as a CSS property. See the CSS
    overflow  property for more information.You can use this attribute
    with the following SVG elements:For a description of the  values,
    please see the css overflow property.BCD tables  only load in the

- pointerEvents (string | number; optional):
    The pointer-events attribute is a presentation attribute that
    allows defining whether or when an element may be the  target of a
    mouse event.Note: As a presentation attribute  pointer-events can
    be used as a CSS property.You can use  this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:For a detailed  explanation of each
    possible value, have a look at the  CSS pointer-events
    documentation.BCD tables only load  in the browser with JavaScript

- preserveAspectRatio (string; optional):
    The preserveAspectRatio attribute indicates how an element with  a
    viewBox providing a given aspect ratio must fit into  a viewport
    with a different aspect ratio.Because the aspect  ratio of an SVG
    image is defined by the viewBox attribute,  if this attribute
    isn't set, the preserveAspectRatio attribute  has no effect (with
    one exception, the <image> element,  as described below).Its value
    is made of one or two keywords:  A required alignment value and an
    optional \"meet or slice\"  reference as described below:The
    alignment value indicates  whether to force uniform scaling and,
    if so, the alignment  method to use in case the aspect ratio of
    the viewBox  doesn't match the aspect ratio of the viewport. The
    alignment  value must be one of the following keywords:The meet or
    slice reference is optional and, if provided, must be  one of the
    following keywords:You can use this attribute  with the following
    SVG elements:For <feImage>, preserveAspectRatio  defines how the
    referenced image should fit in the rectangle  define by the
    <feImage> element.For <image>, preserveAspectRatio  defines how
    the referenced image should fit in the rectangle  define by the
    <image> element.For <marker>, preserveAspectRatio  indicates if a
    uniform scaling must be performed to fit  the element viewport.For
    <pattern>, preserveAspectRatio  indicates if a uniform scaling
    must be performed to fit  the element viewport.For <svg>,
    preserveAspectRatio indicates  if a uniform scaling must be
    performed to fit the element  viewport.For <symbol>,
    preserveAspectRatio indicates if  a uniform scaling must be
    performed to fit the element  viewport.For <view>,
    preserveAspectRatio indicates if  a uniform scaling must be
    performed to fit the element  viewport.Last modified: May 13,

- refX (string | number; optional):
    The refX attribute defines the x coordinate of an element's
    reference  point.You can use this attribute with the following SVG
    elements:For <marker>, refX defines the x coordinate of  the
    marker's reference point, which is to be placed exactly  at the
    marker's position on the shape.Lengths are interpreted  as being
    in the coordinate system of the marker contents,  after
    application of the viewBox and preserveAspectRatio
    attributes.Percentage values are interpreted as being  a
    percentage of the viewBox width.Numbers are interpreted  as being
    in the coordinate system of the marker contents,  after
    application of the viewBox and preserveAspectRatio  attributes.The
    reference point of the marker is placed  at the left edge of the
    shape.The reference point of the  marker is placed at the
    horizontal center of the shape.The  reference point of the marker
    is placed at the right edge  of the shape.For <symbol>, refX
    defines the x coordinate  of the symbol, which is defined by the
    cumulative effect  of the x attribute and any transformations on
    the <symbol>  and its host <use> element.Unlike other positioning
    attributes,  refX is interpreted as being in the coordinate system
    of the symbol contents, after application of the viewBox  and
    preserveAspectRatio attributes. If the attribute is  not
    specified, no horizontal adjustment is made, and the  left side of
    the symbol's rectangular viewport region  (regardless of the
    viewBox coordinate) is positioned at  the x coordinate.Note: For
    backwards compatibility, the  behavior when refX is not specified
    on a <symbol> element  is different from when it is specified with
    a value of  0, and therefore different from the behavior when an
    equivalent  attribute is not specified on a <marker>
    element.Lengths  are interpreted as being in the coordinate system
    of the  marker contents, after application of the viewBox and
    preserveAspectRatio attributes.Percentage values are interpreted
    as being a percentage of the viewBox width.Numbers are
    interpreted as being in the coordinate system of the marker
    contents, after application of the viewBox and preserveAspectRatio
    attributes.The reference point of the marker is placed  at the
    left edge of the shape.The reference point of the  marker is
    placed at the horizontal center of the shape.The  reference point
    of the marker is placed at the right edge  of the shape.Last
    modified: May 13, 2022, by MDN contributors.

- refY (string | number; optional):
    The refY attribute defines the y coordinate of an element's
    reference  point.You can use this attribute with the following SVG
    elements:For <marker>, refY defines the y coordinate of  the
    marker's reference point, which is to be placed exactly  at the
    marker's position on the shape.Lengths are interpreted  as being
    in the coordinate system of the marker contents,  after
    application of the viewBox and preserveAspectRatio
    attributes.Percentage values are interpreted as being  a
    percentage of the viewBox height.Numbers are interpreted  as being
    in the coordinate system of the marker contents,  after
    application of the viewBox and preserveAspectRatio  attributes.The
    reference point of the marker is placed  at the top edge of the
    shape.The reference point of the  marker is placed at the vertical
    center of the shape.The  reference point of the marker is placed
    at the bottom  edge of the shape.For <symbol>, refY defines the y
    coordinate  of the symbol, which is defined by the cumulative
    effect  of the y attribute and any transformations on the <symbol>
    and its host <use> element.Unlike other positioning attributes,
    refY is interpreted as being in the coordinate system  of the
    symbol contents, after application of the viewBox  and
    preserveAspectRatio attributes. If the attribute is  not
    specified, no vertical adjustment is made, and the  top side of
    the symbol's rectangular viewport region (regardless  of the
    viewBox coordinate) is positioned at the y coordinate.Note:  For
    backwards compatibility, the behavior when refY is  not specified
    on a <symbol> element is different from  when it is specified with
    a value of 0, and therefore  different from the behavior when an
    equivalent attribute  is not specified on a <marker>
    element.Lengths are interpreted  as being in the coordinate system
    of the marker contents,  after application of the viewBox and
    preserveAspectRatio  attributes.Percentage values are interpreted
    as being  a percentage of the viewBox height.Numbers are
    interpreted  as being in the coordinate system of the marker
    contents,  after application of the viewBox and
    preserveAspectRatio  attributes.The reference point of the marker
    is placed  at the top edge of the shape.The reference point of the
    marker is placed at the vertical center of the shape.The
    reference point of the marker is placed at the bottom  edge of the
    shape.Last modified: May 13, 2022, by MDN  contributors.

- role (string; optional):
    The ARIA role attribute.

- style (dict with strings as keys and values of type string | number; optional):
    CSS style to apply to the element.

- transform (string; optional):
    Transformation to apply to the element.

- viewBox (string; optional):
    The viewBox attribute defines the position and dimension, in  user
    space, of an SVG viewport.The value of the viewBox  attribute is a
    list of four numbers: min-x, min-y, width  and height. The
    numbers, which are separated by whitespace  and/or a comma,
    specify a rectangle in user space which  is mapped to the bounds
    of the viewport established for  the associated SVG element (not
    the browser viewport).You  can use this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:The  exact effect of this attribute is
    influenced by the preserveAspectRatio  attribute.Note: Values for
    width or height lower or equal  to 0 disable rendering of the
    element.For <marker>, viewBox  defines the position and dimension
    for the content of  the <marker> element.For <pattern>, viewBox
    defines the  position and dimension for the content of the pattern
    tile.For <svg>, viewBox defines the position and dimension  for
    the content of the <svg> element.For <symbol>, viewBox  defines
    the position and dimension for the content of  the <symbol>
    element.For <view>, viewBox defines the position  and dimension
    for the content of the <view> element.Last  modified: May 13,
