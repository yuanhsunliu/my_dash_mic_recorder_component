class Polygon(Component):
    """A Polygon component.
Polygon is a wrapper for the <polygon> SVG element.
For detailed attribute info see:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/polygon

Keyword arguments:

- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):
    The children of this component.

- id (string; optional):
    The ID of this component, used to identify dash components in
    callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components
    in an app.

- aria-* (string; optional):
    A wildcard aria attribute.

- className (string; optional):
    Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.

- clipPath (string; optional):
    The clip-path presentation attribute defines or associates a
    clipping path with the element it is related to.Note:  As a
    presentation attribute clip-path can be used as a  CSS
    property.You can use this attribute with the following  SVG
    elements:An extra information to tell how a <basic-shape>  is
    applied to an element: fill-box indicates to use the  object
    bounding box; stroke-box indicates to use the object  bounding box
    extended with the stroke; view-box indicates  to use the nearest
    SVG viewport as the reference box.Note:  For more details on the
    clip-path syntax, see the CSS  property clip-path reference
    page.BCD tables only load  in the browser with JavaScript enabled.

- colorInterpolation (string | number; optional):
    The color-interpolation attribute specifies the color space for
    gradient interpolations, color animations, and alpha
    compositing.Note:  For filter effects, the
    color-interpolation-filters property  controls which color space
    is used.The color-interpolation  property chooses between color
    operations occurring in  the sRGB color space or in a (light
    energy linear) linearized  RGB color space. Having chosen the
    appropriate color space,  component-wise linear interpolation is
    used.When a child  element is blended into a background, the value
    of the  color-interpolation property on the child determines the
    type of blending, not the value of the color-interpolation  on the
    parent. For gradients which make use of the href  or the
    deprecated xlink:href attribute to reference another  gradient,
    the gradient uses the property's value from  the gradient element
    which is directly referenced by the  fill or stroke property. When
    animating colors, color  interpolation is performed according to
    the value of the  color-interpolation property on the element
    being animated.Note:  As a presentation attribute,
    color-interpolation can be  used as a CSS property.You can use
    this attribute with  the following SVG elements:Indicates that the
    user agent  can choose either the sRGB or linearRGB spaces for
    color  interpolation. This option indicates that the author
    doesn't  require that color interpolation occur in a particular
    color space.Indicates that color interpolation should  occur in
    the sRGB color space.Indicates that color interpolation  should
    occur in the linearized RGB color space as described  in the sRGB
    specification.BCD tables only load in the  browser with JavaScript

- data-* (string; optional):
    A wildcard data attribute.

- fill (string; optional):
    fill color.

- fillOpacity (string | number; optional):
    The fill-opacity attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the opacity of the paint server (color, gradient, pattern,  etc)
    applied to a shape.Note: As a presentation attribute  fill-opacity
    can be used as a CSS property.You can use  this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:Note: SVG2  introduces percentage values
    for fill-opacity, however,  it is not widely supported yet (See
    Browser compatibility  below) as a consequence, it is best
    practices to set opacity  with a value in the range [0-1].BCD

- fillRule (a value equal to: "evenodd", "inherit", "nonzero"; optional):
    The fill-rule attribute is a presentation attribute defining  the
    algorithm to use to determine the inside part of a  shape.Note: As
    a presentation attribute, fill-rule can  be used as a CSS
    property.You can use this attribute with  the following SVG
    elements:The fill-rule attribute provides  two options for how the
    inside (that is, the area to be  filled) of a shape is
    determined:The value nonzero determines  the \"insideness\" of a
    point in the shape by drawing a  ray from that point to infinity
    in any direction, and  then examining the places where a segment
    of the shape  crosses the ray. Starting with a count of zero, add
    one  each time a path segment crosses the ray from left to  right
    and subtract one each time a path segment crosses  the ray from
    right to left. After counting the crossings,  if the result is
    zero then the point is outside the path.  Otherwise, it is
    inside.The value evenodd determines the  \"insideness\" of a point
    in the shape by drawing a ray  from that point to infinity in any
    direction and counting  the number of path segments from the given
    shape that  the ray crosses. If this number is odd, the point is
    inside;  if even, the point is outside.BCD tables only load in

    the same as the first vertex. In this case,  if the value of
    marker-start and marker-end are both not  none, then two markers
    will be rendered on that final  vertex. For <path> elements, for
    each closed subpath,  the last vertex is the same as the first
    vertex. marker-end  is only rendered on the final vertex of the
    path data.Note:  As a presentation attribute, marker-end can be
    used as  a CSS property.You can use this attribute with the
    following  SVG elements:Indicates that no marker symbol shall be
    drawn at the final vertex.This value is a reference to  a <marker>

    bind a given <mask> element with the element the attribute
    belongs to.Note: As a presentation attribute mask can  be used as
    a CSS property.You can use this attribute with  the following SVG
    elements:Since SVG2, the mask attribute  is defined as a css
    property and is a shorthand for many  other properties:
    mask-image, mask-mode, mask-repeat,  mask-position, mask-clip,

    changed most recently.

- opacity (string | number; optional):
    The opacity attribute specifies the transparency of an object  or
    of a group of objects, that is, the degree to which  the
    background behind the element is overlaid.Note: As  a presentation
    attribute, opacity can be used as a CSS  property. See the css
    opacity property for more information.You  can use this attribute
    with the following SVG elements:The  uniform opacity setting to be
    applied across an entire  object, as a <number>. Any values

- paintOrder (string | number; optional):
    The paint-order attribute specifies the order that the fill,
    stroke, and markers of a given shape or text element are
    painted.Note: As a presentation attribute, paint-order  can be
    used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the
    following SVG elements:This value indicates that  the fill will be
    painted first, then the stroke, and finally  the markers.The order
    of these three keywords indicates  the order in which the painting
    happens, from left to  right. If any of the three painting
    components is omitted,  they will be painted in their default
    order after the  specified components. For example, using stroke
    is equivalent  to stroke fill markers.The example would be
    rendered as  follows:    The stroke under effect could be achieved
    via the following CSS property:BCD tables only load in  the

- pathLength (string | number; optional):
    The pathLength attribute lets authors specify a total length  for
    the path, in user units. This value is then used to  calibrate the
    browser's distance calculations with those  of the author, by
    scaling all distance computations using  the ratio
    pathLength/(computed value of path length).This  can affect the
    actual rendered lengths of paths; including  text paths, animation
    paths, and various stroke operations.  Basically, all computations
    that require the length of  the path. stroke-dasharray, for
    example, will assume the  start of the path being 0 and the end
    point the value  defined in the pathLength attribute.You can use
    this attribute  with the following SVG elements:For <circle>,
    pathLength  lets authors specify a total length for the circle, in
    user units.For <ellipse>, pathLength lets authors specify  a total
    length for the ellipse, in user units.For <line>,  pathLength lets
    authors specify a total length for the  line, in user units.For
    <path>, pathLength lets authors  specify a total length for the
    path, in user units.For  <polygon>, pathLength lets authors
    specify a total length  for the shape, in user units.For
    <polyline>, pathLength  lets authors specify a total length for
    the shape, in  user units.For <rect>, pathLength lets authors
    specify  a total length for the rectangle, in user units.Last

- pointerEvents (string | number; optional):
    The pointer-events attribute is a presentation attribute that
    allows defining whether or when an element may be the  target of a
    mouse event.Note: As a presentation attribute  pointer-events can
    be used as a CSS property.You can use  this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:For a detailed  explanation of each
    possible value, have a look at the  CSS pointer-events
    documentation.BCD tables only load  in the browser with JavaScript

- points (string; optional):
    The points attribute defines a list of points. Each point is
    defined by a pair of number representing a X and a Y coordinate
    in the user coordinate system. If the attribute contains  an odd
    number of coordinates, the last one will be ignored.You  can use
    this attribute with the following SVG elements:For  <polyline>,
    points defines a list of points, each representing  a vertex of
    the line to be drawn. Each point is define  by a X and Y
    coordinate in the user coordinate system.Note:  A polyline is an
    open shape, meaning the last point is  not connected to the first
    point.For <polygon>, points  defines a list of points, each
    representing a vertex of  the shape to be drawn. Each point is
    define by a X and  Y coordinate in the user coordinate
    system.Note: A polygon  is a closed shape, meaning the last point
    is connected  to the first point.Last modified: May 13, 2022, by

- requiredFeatures (string | number; optional):
    Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
    browsers might still support it, it may have already been  removed
    from the relevant web standards, may be in the  process of being
    dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility  purposes. Avoid
    using it, and update existing code if  possible; see the
    compatibility table at the bottom of  this page to guide your
    decision. Be aware that this feature  may cease to work at any
    time.The requiredFeatures attribute  takes a list of feature
    strings, with the individual strings  separated by white space. It
    determines whether or not  all of the named features are supported
    by the browser;  if all of them are supported, the attribute
    evaluates  to True end the element is rendered; otherwise, the
    attribute  evaluates to False and the current element and its
    children  are skipped and thus will not be rendered. This provides
    a way to design SVG that gracefully falls back when features
    aren't available.If the attribute is not present, then  its
    implicit evaluated value is True. If a None string  or empty
    string value is given to attribute requiredFeatures,  the
    attribute is evaluate to False.requiredFeatures is  often used in
    conjunction with the <switch> element. If  requiredFeatures is
    used in other situations, it represents  a simple switch on the
    given element whether to render  the element or not.To detect
    availability of an SVG feature  from script, there is the (also
    deprecated) DOMImplementation.hasFeature()  method.You can use
    this attribute with the following SVG  elements:This is a list of
    feature strings, separated  using white space. Determines whether
    all of the named  features are supported by the browser. See
    Feature strings  below for a list of allowed values.The following
    are the  feature strings for the requiredFeatures attribute. These
    same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method call  that is
    part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation
    interface. In some cases the feature strings map directly  to a
    set of attributes, properties or elements, in others  they
    represent some functionality of the browser. Note  that the format
    and naming for feature strings changed  from SVG 1.0 to SVG 1.1.
    The SVG 1.0 feature strings are  not listed here but can be found
    in the SVG Specification.  Some browser support SVG 1.0 Feature
    strings for compatibility  reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature
    strings are considered  deprecated.At least one of the following
    feature is supported:At  least one of the following feature is

- role (string; optional):
    The ARIA role attribute.

- shapeRendering (string | number; optional):
    The shape-rendering attribute provides hints to the renderer
    about what tradeoffs to make when rendering shapes like  paths,
    circles, or rectangles.Note: As a presentation  attribute,
    shape-rendering can be used as a CSS property.You  can use this
    attribute with the following SVG elements:This  value indicates
    that the user agent shall make appropriate  tradeoffs to balance
    speed, crisp edges and geometric  precision, but with geometric
    precision given more importance  than speed and crisp edges.This
    value indicates that the  user agent shall emphasize rendering
    speed over geometric  precision and crisp edges. This option will
    sometimes  cause the user agent to turn off shape
    anti-aliasing.This  value indicates that the user agent shall
    attempt to emphasize  the contrast between clean edges of artwork
    over rendering  speed and geometric precision. To achieve crisp
    edges,  the user agent might turn off anti-aliasing for all lines
    and curves or possibly just for straight lines which are  close to
    vertical or horizontal. Also, the user agent  might adjust line
    positions and line widths to align edges  with device
    pixels.Indicates that the user agent shall  emphasize geometric
    precision over speed and crisp edges.BCD  tables only load in the

- stroke (string; optional):
    stroke color.

- strokeDasharray (string | number; optional):
    The stroke-dasharray attribute is a presentation attribute
    defining  the pattern of dashes and gaps used to paint the outline
    of the shape;Note: As a presentation attribute, stroke-dasharray
    can be used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the
    following SVG elements:A list of comma and/or  white space
    separated <length>s and <percentage>s that  specify the lengths of
    alternating dashes and gaps.If  an odd number of values is
    provided, then the list of  values is repeated to yield an even
    number of values.  Thus, 5,3,2 is equivalent to 5,3,2,5,3,2.BCD

- strokeDashoffset (string | number; optional):
    The stroke-dashoffset attribute is a presentation attribute
    defining  an offset on the rendering of the associated dash
    array.Note:  As a presentation attribute stroke-dashoffset can be
    used  as a CSS property.You can use this attribute with the
    following SVG elements:The offset is usually expressed  in user
    units resolved against the pathLength but if a  <percentage> is
    used, the value is resolved as a percentage  of the current
    viewport.BCD tables only load in the browser  with JavaScript

- strokeLinejoin (a value equal to: "bevel", "inherit", "miter", "round"; optional):
    The stroke-linejoin attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the shape to be used at the corners of paths when they  are
    stroked.Note: As a presentation attribute stroke-linejoin  can be
    used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the
    following SVG elements:Note: The arcs value as  been introduced in
    SVG2 and it isn't widely supported  yet, see Browser compatibility
    below for details.The arcs  value indicates that an arcs corner is
    to be used to join  path segments. The arcs shape is formed by
    extending the  outer edges of the stroke at the join point with
    arcs  that have the same curvature as the outer edges at the  join
    point.The bevel value indicates that a bevelled corner  is to be
    used to join path segments.The miter value indicates  that a sharp
    corner is to be used to join path segments.  The corner is formed
    by extending the outer edges of the  stroke at the tangents of the
    path segments until they  intersect.Note: If the stroke-miterlimit
    is exceeded,  the line join falls back to bevel.Note: the
    miter-clip  value as been introduced in SVG2 and it isn't widely
    supported  yet, see Browser compatibility below for details.The
    miter-clip  value indicates that a sharp corner is to be used to
    join  path segments. The corner is formed by extending the outer
    edges of the stroke at the tangents of the path segments  until
    they intersect.If the stroke-miterlimit is exceeded,  the miter is
    clipped at a distance equal to half the stroke-miterlimit  value
    multiplied by the stroke width from the intersection  of the path
    segments. This provides a better rendering  than miter on very
    sharp join or in case of an animation.The  round value indicates
    that a round corner is to be used  to join path segments.BCD

- strokeMiterlimit (string | number; optional):
    The stroke-miterlimit attribute is a presentation attribute
    defining  a limit on the ratio of the miter length to the
    stroke-width  used to draw a miter join. When the limit is
    exceeded,  the join is converted from a miter to a bevel.Note: As
    a presentation attribute stroke-miterlimit can be used  as a CSS
    property.You can use this attribute with the  following SVG
    elements:When two line segments meet at  a sharp angle and miter
    joins have been specified for  stroke-linejoin, it is possible for
    the miter to extend  far beyond the thickness of the line stroking
    the path.  The stroke-miterlimit ratio is used to define when the
    limit is exceeded, if so the join is converted from a  miter to a
    bevel.The ratio of miter length (distance between  the outer tip
    and the inner corner of the miter) to stroke-width  is directly
    related to the angle (theta) between the segments  in user space
    by the formula:               stroke-miterlimit        =
    miterLength                              stroke-width
    =                            1
    sin                            (
    θ                                                      2
    )                                                  For example, a
    miter  limit of 1.414 converts miters to bevels for theta less
    than 90 degrees, a limit of 4.0 converts them for theta  less than
    approximately 29 degrees, and a limit of 10.0  converts them for
    theta less than approximately 11.5 degrees.The  value of
    stroke-miterlimit must be greater than or equal  to 1.BCD tables

- strokeOpacity (string | number; optional):
    The stroke-opacity attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the opacity of the paint server (color, gradient, pattern,  etc)
    applied to the stroke of a shape.Note: As a presentation
    attribute stroke-opacity can be used as a CSS property.You  can
    use this attribute with the following SVG elements:Note:  SVG2
    introduces percentage values for stroke-opacity,  however, it is
    not widely supported yet (See Browser compatibility  below) as a
    consequence, it is best practices to set opacity  with a value in
    the range [0-1].It's important to know  that the stroke partially
    covers the fill of a shape,  so a stroke with an opacity different
    than 1 will partially  show the fill underneath. To avoid this
    effect, it is  possible to apply a global opacity with the opacity
    attribute  or to put the stroke behind the fill with the
    paint-order  attribute.BCD tables only load in the browser with

- strokeWidth (string | number; optional):
    The stroke-width attribute is a presentation attribute defining
    the width of the stroke to be applied to the shape.You  can use
    this attribute with the following SVG elements:Note:  A percentage
    value is always computed as a percentage  of the normalized
    viewBox diagonal length.BCD tables only  load in the browser with

- style (dict with strings as keys and values of type string | number; optional):
    CSS style to apply to the element.

- systemLanguage (string | number; optional):
    The systemLanguage attribute represents a list of supported
    language  tags. This list is matched against the language defined
    in the user preferences.You can use this attribute with  the
    following SVG elements:The value is a set of comma-separated
    tokens, each of which must be a language tag, as defined  in RFC
    5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known  as BCP
    47).systemLanguage is often used in conjunction  with the <switch>
    element. If the attribute is used in  other situations, then it
    represents a simple switch on  the given element whether to render
    the element or not.Note:  If several alternative language objects
    are enclosed in  a <switch> and none of them matches, this may
    lead to  situations where no content is displayed. It is thus
    recommended  to include a \"catch-all\" choice at the end of such
    a <switch>  which is acceptable in all cases.The attribute
    evaluates  to \"True\" if one of the language tags indicated by
    user  preferences is a case-insensitive match or prefix (followed
    by a \"-\") of one of the language tags given in the value  of
    this parameter. Otherwise it evaluates to \"False\".Note:  The
    prefix matching rule does not imply that if a user  understands a
    language with a certain tag, that the user  will also understand
    all languages with the tag as prefix.If  the attribute is not
    present, then it implicitly evaluates  to \"True\". If a None
    string or empty string value is given,  the attribute evaluates to
    \"False\".The prefix rule allows  the use of prefix tags if this
    is the case.Multiple languages  may be listed for content that is
    intended for multiple  audiences. For example, content that is
    presented simultaneously  in the original Maori and English
    versions, would call  for:However, just because multiple languages
    are present  within the object on which the systemLanguage test
    attribute  is placed, this does not mean that it is intended for
    multiple linguistic audiences. An example would be a beginner's
    language primer, such as \"A First Lesson in Latin,\" which  is
    clearly intended to be used by an English-literate  audience. In
    this case, the attribute should only include  en.BCD tables only

- transform (string; optional):
    Transformation to apply to the element.

- vectorEffect (string | number; optional):
    The vector-effect property specifies the vector effect to use
    when drawing an object. Vector effects are applied before  any of
    the other compositing operations, i.e. filters,  masks and
    clips.Note: As a presentation attribute, vector-effect  can be
    used as a CSS property.You can use this attribute  with the
    following SVG elements:This value specifies that  no vector effect
    shall be applied, i.e. the default rendering  behavior is used
    which is to first fill the geometry of  a shape with a specified
    paint, then stroke the outline  with a specified paint.This value
    modifies the way an  object is stroked. Normally stroking involves
    calculating  stroke outline of the shape's path in current user
    coordinate  system and filling that outline with the stroke paint
    (color or gradient). The resulting visual effect of this  value is
    that the stroke width is not dependent on the  transformations of
    the element (including non-uniform  scaling and shear
    transformations) and zoom level.This  value specifies a special
    user coordinate system used  by the element and its descendants.
    The scale of that  user coordinate system does not change in spite
    of any  transformation changes from a host coordinate space.
    However,  it does not specify the suppression of rotation and
    skew.  Also, it does not specify the origin of the user coordinate
    system. Since this value suppresses scaling of the user
    coordinate system, it also has the characteristics of
    non-scaling-stroke.This value specifies a special user  coordinate
    system used by the element and its descendants.  The rotation and
    skew of that user coordinate system is  suppressed in spite of any
    transformation changes from  a host coordinate space. However, it
    does not specify  the suppression of scaling. Also, it does not
    specify  the origin of user coordinate system.This value specifies
    a special user coordinate system used by the element and  its
    descendants. The position of user coordinate system  is fixed in
    spite of any transformation changes from a  host coordinate space.
    However, it does not specify the  suppression of rotation, skew
    and scaling. When this vector  effect and the transform property
    are defined at the same  time, that property is consumed for this
    effect.BCD tables  only load in the browser with JavaScript

- visibility (string | number; optional):
    The visibility attribute lets you control the visibility of
    graphical  elements. With a value of hidden or collapse the
    current  graphics element is invisible.Note: If the visibility
    attribute is set to hidden on a text element, then the  text is
    invisible but still takes up space in text layout
    calculations.Depending on the value of attribute pointer-events,
    graphics elements which have their visibility attribute  set to
    hidden still might receive events.Note: As a presentation
    attribute, visibility can be used as a CSS property. See  the css
    visibility property for more information.You can  use this
    attribute with the following SVG elements:The  following example
    toggles the CSS visibility of the SVG  image path.This value
    indicates that the element will  be painted.This value indicates
    that the element will  not be painted. Though it is still part of
    the rendering  tree, i.e. it may receive pointer events depending
    on  the pointer-events attribute, may receive focus depending  on
    the tabindex attribute, contributes to bounding box  calculations
    and clipping paths, and does affect text  layout.This value is
    equal to hidden.BCD tables only load  in the browser with
